Postmortem Report
Issue Summary
On May 5, 2024, at 08:30 AM (GMT), there was an unprecedented service disruption that lasted until 04:15 PM (GMT). Our flagship messaging service was affected, disrupting communication for 30% of our user base.

Root Cause
During routine maintenance, a misconfigured load balancer initiated a cascading failure, which led to the disruption of our messaging service. The misconfiguration caused an uneven distribution of traffic, leading to some servers being overwhelmed while leaving others underutilized.

Impact
The cascading failure affected our flagship messaging service, disrupting communication for 30% of our user base.

Timeline
Detection:
At 08:30 AM (GMT), automated monitoring alerted the on-call engineer to an unusual spike in error rates.

Investigation:
The team immediately began investigating the elevated error rates, initially suspecting a potential DDoS attack due to the sudden influx of traffic. However, further analysis revealed a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to improper distribution of incoming requests.

Misleading Paths:
A preliminary assumption suggested database issues, leading to an unnecessary deep dive into database logs and queries. Network latency was also explored as a potential culprit, diverting focus from the actual misconfiguration.

Escalation:
The incident was escalated to the system reliability team as the complexity of the issue became apparent.

Resolution:
To provide immediate relief, we rolled back the recent load balancer configuration changes. A comprehensive fix was implemented by reconfiguring the load balancer settings to ensure proper request distribution.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic, causing some servers to be overwhelmed while leaving others underutilized.

Resolution:
Immediate relief was achieved by reverting to the previous load balancer configuration. A permanent fix was implemented by reconfiguring the load balancer to evenly distribute incoming requests, validated through extensive testing.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Implement regular audits of critical infrastructure configurations to catch anomalies before they escalate.
Enhance monitoring thresholds to detect unusual patterns in load balancer performance.

Tasks:
Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations across all services.
Enhance documentation for load balancer maintenance procedures to avoid future misconfigurations.
Implement automated checks to validate load balancer configurations after updates.
Schedule training sessions for the operations team to ensure familiarity with load balancer management best practices.

Conclusion
This incident highlighted the importance of regular infrastructure audits and vigilant monitoring. Although unintentional, the misconfiguration in the load balancer had a significant impact on user experience. Our commitment to continuous improvement involves not only resolving incidents promptly but also implementing measures to prevent recurrence. The outlined corrective actions will strengthen our systems and ensure a more robust and resilient service for our users.
